"""Mixed-version back-compat matrix: a real bus, two venvs, four combos.

Why this exists
---------------

The conformance suites in ``test/conformance/`` install one stack from
``requirements.txt`` and run against it, and pip installs one package per name.
That is the harness's documented single-ref-per-repo limitation, and it makes a
whole class of bug invisible here: the breakage this suite is about is
*definitionally* cross-version, a skill container frozen months ago talking to
a stack that moved on. Seeing it needs two package sets alive at once, which
means two venvs and a real websocket between them.

This is the harness's cross-repo home for that pattern. ``ovos-core`` carries
its own copy of this suite, deliberately: a stack contract is pinned where the
stack lives, so a breakage is traceable to the repo that caused it. The two
copies are meant to run in parallel and say the same thing.

What moved
----------

OVOS-MSG-1 §2.1.1 builds the per-intent dispatch topic as
``<skill_id>:<intent_name>``. Old ``ovos-workshop`` built it from the
padatious resource **filename**, so the authoring extension leaked onto the
wire as ``<skill_id>:food.order.intent``. Two independent changes then landed:

* ``ovos-padatious >= 2.0.1a1`` folds the suffixed id onto the canonical
  ``<skill_id>:food.order`` at **registration** time, so every match — and
  therefore every dispatch, since ``ovos-core`` forwards ``match.match_type``
  verbatim — is canonical;
* ``ovos-workshop >= 9.3.2a1`` binds the handler to **both** spellings, so a
  skill built against it survives either dispatch.

The interesting cell is the one where those two miss each other: a skill built
against ``ovos-workshop == 9.3.1a2`` binds the suffixed topic **only**, and a
current core dispatches the canonical topic **only**.

The matrix
----------

===================  ==================  =================  ============
combo                skill binds         core dispatches    handler runs
===================  ==================  =================  ============
old skill/old core   suffixed only       suffixed           yes
old skill/new core   suffixed only       canonical          **no**
new skill/old core   both                suffixed           yes
new skill/new core   both                canonical          yes (once)
===================  ==================  =================  ============

Only ``old skill/new core`` is broken, and it is marked
``xfail(strict=True)``. The other three are passing controls: they prove the
harness can see a handler fire at all, so the one red cell is a real finding
and not a broken fixture.

How it gets fixed, and why the fix lands where it does
------------------------------------------------------

The old container does **not** ship an old ``ovos-bus-client``. Its workshop
pin declares a floor, not a ceiling, so a rebuilt container resolves the
current client — this suite asserts that, because the whole repair strategy
depends on it. ``ovos-bus-client#271`` puts an alias-driven mirror on the
**receive** side of every client: the old skill's own ``bus.on("…​.intent")``
fills an ``IntentAliasRegistry``, and when the canonical dispatch arrives from
the wire the client mirrors it locally onto the suffixed twin. The handler
then runs without the skill or the wire changing at all.

That is also why the mirror is receive-side rather than emit-side: the fix has
to execute in the process that owns the stale binding, and only that process
knows what it bound.

Kill-switch role
----------------

These four cells are a gate on the compat train, in both directions:

* the day ``#271`` releases, ``old skill/new core`` starts passing,
  ``strict=True`` turns that into a loud XPASS failure, and the marker comes
  off — the guard is then permanent;
* ``ovos-workshop#500`` removes the suffixed binding, which turns
  ``new skill/old core`` red. That cell must not be deleted to make the PR
  green; it is the signal that the inbound direction (suffixed wire topic →
  canonical local listener) is still missing from the client;
* any PR that drops the compat must flip these deliberately.

Running it
----------

The combo is selected by environment, so one script serves all four CI matrix
entries::

    BACKCOMPAT_COMBO=old-skill/new-core \\
    BACKCOMPAT_SKILL_PYTHON=/path/to/venv_skill_old/bin/python \\
    <core-venv>/bin/pytest test/backcompat/

``test/backcompat/build_venvs.sh`` builds the four venvs with the pins above.
