# Build the four venvs the mixed-version back-compat matrix runs against.
#
# Two venvs are alive per combo: one holds the skill's packages, one holds the
# core's. They talk over a real websocket, which is the only way one test run
# can observe two different package sets.
#
# Usage:  test/backcompat/build_venvs.sh <target-dir> [core-spec]
#
# This harness installs no package of its own (see docs/how-it-works.md), so
# the "new core" side is pinned to a ref the way requirements.txt pins the rest
# of the stack. ovos-core carries its own copy of this suite, where that side
# is the checkout under test instead.
#
# Pins, and why each one is where it is:
#
#   skill_old  ovos-workshop==9.3.1a2
#              The newest release that binds the handler to the suffixed
#              `<skill_id>:<file>.intent` topic ONLY. 9.3.2a1 added the
#              canonical binding alongside it (ovos-workshop#497), which hides
#              the breakage, so the pin must stay below that line.
#              ovos-bus-client is deliberately NOT pinned: a real frozen
#              container resolves the workshop floor and gets a current client,
#              and the repair in ovos-bus-client#271 depends on exactly that.
#
#   skill_new  ovos-workshop @ dev
#              Binds both spellings today. ovos-workshop#500 makes it
#              canonical-only, which is what will turn the new-skill/old-core
#              cell red.
#
#   core_old   ovos-core==2.5.5a2 + ovos-padatious==2.0.0a1
#              The newest padatious release BEFORE registration-time
#              canonicalization (`_dealias_intent_name`, added in 2.0.1a1), so
#              this side dispatches whatever the skill registered. ovos-core is
#              pinned to its contemporary release; core itself forwards
#              `match.match_type` verbatim, so the pipeline plugin is the part
#              that decides the spelling.
#
#   core_new   ovos-core @ dev + ovos-padatious>=2.0.1a2
#              Folds at registration, so it dispatches the canonical topic.
#
#   venv_skill_stable / venv_skill_testing
#   venv_core_stable  / venv_core_testing
#              Not boundary pins — fleet pins. Built by installing straight
#              off the OVOS distro's own constraint files, fetched at build
#              time (not vendored), so this gate TRACKS the fleet: the day the
#              distro bumps a pin past a behavior boundary, the affected cell
#              goes red at that exact moment, which is the point. Today both
#              channels resolve an ovos-workshop and ovos-padatious floor well
#              below the 9.3.2a1 / 2.0.1a1 boundaries above, so the *-skill
#              side is suffixed-only and the *-core side never canonicalizes
#              on either channel — see test_mixed_version_matrix.py for what
#              that implies per cell. The fetched constraints file is saved
#              into $TARGET for upload as a CI artifact, so a future red cell
#              can be traced back to exactly what was pinned that day.
